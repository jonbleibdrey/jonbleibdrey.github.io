Rails, Where to begin...?!

I actually love Rails: it’s gentle, complex, even a bit sexy. This is my breif description about Rails, For the first time I feel I actually understand what all this was for! Was it always like that? NOT AT ALL! I literally was thinking in my head "okay well, I guess, I could go back to film making" or "maybe I could become a writer instead....YEA that could work!" All types of random thoughts flowed to my mind. It almost got to me too; those faint whispers from your ego ( I’m coming to get you BARBARA!). " could I ever get through this?" I thought or " am I good enough"? The answer was, YES! We have more power in us than we think; major lesson from this project is: DONT GIVE YOUR POWER AWAY! I was giving my power away to the fear this all had to be perfect. I am here to say " ENJOY the Journey, instead of the end result." Anyways here are my good and bad thoughts of Ruby on Rails.

let’s start with the good:

Rails has a ton tricks up her sleeves, with helpers to make your life cleaner, to make your code a bit more formal and easy to read information.

We started off this journey with something called the RESTfull routes, most of you heard of it from back in Sinatra land. Basically, that means there are seven main routes that make it easier to connect the views and the controller almost like magic! Also known as CRUD, our apps should be able to CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE! It has so many helpers and partials that if you connect the view page inside of the helper or partial you are allowed to put a simple render code inside the view (which keeps code looking fresh). Then take the heavy code, put it away for safe keeping and out of site. Forms also got an upgrade: they make it super simple with something called form builder. It basically does all the work for you allowing for simple four lines of code (if you wanted). Then there are resources and nested resources that allows you to get your tables all on one page instead of leaving one page to get info you stay on a single page. It really is like Christmas!


Now the bad:

"HOLY hell this stuff is dense" I remember a few people saying that to me multiple times. I was overwhelmed with all the information, then to learn it in a month (good lord!!!). As of right now at this present moment, it all makes sense and I’m calmly writing this blog post. BUT that was not the case earlier, you definitely have to bring your big boy pants to Rails. I would not wish this on my worst enemy...! Find a group to practice with, find books, Hell find a pet to hold on to. It will challenge you very much so, if you make it through, trust me you feel like on top of the world.IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE you just entered outer space from Earth, BUT slowly realizing you entered into a VAST UNIVERSE!

LASTLY thank you for reading this post, that was my breif and ossibly vague description of Rails, it’s been fun and hope to see you soon.
