Where to begin? As we go on this journey together, I have made many arbitrary analogies for each code program. Let me explain: for every project I end up using some type of simple "kid" language to explain what in the world is happening. Last project I used digging a hole and the *data* was the dirt and *arrays* and *hashes* were blocks we had to get through. How I know it makes sense, is when I talk and tell my peers about it they understand.  The funny part is that it actually sticks! So, for this project I used trains and trolleys for my analogy and thats where the fun begins...

I think of my controller section or our *get/post* methods as a train station...(to pause and giggle)! From this train station you either redirect to or erb tag which pretty much tells the trains which direction to steer. So if I put *:/journal/edit*, that's where you will be heading. Now, in between there we sometimes have variables that is kind of like a trolley that holds some type of goods or data. So you load up that train with information that can only go from the *view* and the *controller* and not between *get/post* stations because there is no railroad between there....Then it departs, goes to that specific train station that we* redirect to* or *erb tagged*. 

So it travelled there, great! Now we are in the “make it look pretty section” or the *views* section (that’s how I remember it). This is where the user interacts, central hubb station, and I personally love making the user happy and add value to that person in some way! So I make some hello banners, some submit buttons and we have it all packed! Thinking about how I would like to interact with this app, would I want to go all the way back to the homepage to edit a single sentence or would I want to just do it right on the spot? Simple is always the name of the game with coding...Away we go to the next stop but not for everyone. Sometimes only one stop is necessary, like a page for a simple greeting. But for those few that want to take another ride we go to *POST* land because they have data!!

*Post* land is like *get* land except you have got some goods (data). Now we have to take them somewhere...! We get to our destination, unload our data in a sorting machine(our methods) and now we have more usable data that we didn’t before. So we can do things like: save, edit, delete etc to our train...!

Rinse, recycle, and repeat! Besides the maddening folder structure and getting the train started, it was a glorious fun RIDE!

So in a nut shell, that’s how I like to think of it. There is 100%  better ways to explain Sinatra , but this one was the funnest(I know it’s not a real word). Thank you for sharing this journey I’ll see you next time. but until then GOD BLESS AMERICA!
