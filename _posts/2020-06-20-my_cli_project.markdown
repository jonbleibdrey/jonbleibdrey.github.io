Wow what a magical process! where to even begin?

I first looked at the CLI project when I started flatiron school, lingering in the future, it made me a bit scared.
As the days narrowed down I was very worried thinking, how am I going to get through this? 
My feeling each week would start like this: Monday "I can do this",Tuesday "yea I got this", Wednesday "wait what?", Thursday “panic attack, and cry", Friday "what just happened" and then weekends "restudy the whole week over agian". 
rinse, recycle, and repeat.

so the weekend before "project week", I went through all the material again.
just to review and be prepared so this time I was sure I had it.
I was pumped "I can do this , I can do this" 

BOOM!

I felt like a man that was just given a bunch of random tools, on a deserted island and was told to build a city.
"I nearly crapped myself". here is what transpired...


Monday: woke up, ate breakfast, sat at my computer with a cup of coffee. 
looked up weather, poked around at a few things.
then got to work deciding whether I was going to scrape data or do an API. 
I went with api (scraping is a bit too complicated at this present moment.... or so I thought at the time) 
so I’m going through website after website, finally finding an api page filled with random quotes 
"awesome, GREAT, moving on!" 

then looked at all the data..... 

"sweet yea I got this, yea it will be easy"(reassuring myself thousands of times).
so I set up file formats, create a repository and follow along with a video my teacher had posted.
put my kid to bed, had dinner and then went to bed!

Tuesday: woke up, ate breakfast, sat at my computer with coffee.

"OMG WHAT DID I DO?!" 

I went straight panic mood "I don’t know how to get that element, out of that box, that inside of a hash, inside of another array!" thinking to myself.
I’m going from sitting to standing , to siting bouncing on my yoga ball nervously.
asking other students for help, talking me through it, they get me over a hill. 

"freaking amazing, I AM STEVE JOBS!!" I thought to myself.

"just to reveal another hundred hills, we had to climb".

I finished at eight and complained to my wife for the rest of the night “this is so hard, what am I even doing here, what was I thinking becoming a software engineer!"....

I shuffle my feet to my bed, almost having a panic attack and go to bed.

Wednesday: woke up, ate breakfast, sat at my computer with a cup of coffee.
bouncing on my chair, I slow down and say to myself " Jon you can either do two things: 1.sit here and complain about how hard this is, OR, 2.find solutions to all this and change my thought process, WE CAN DO THIS!" 
I pop into a zoom chat with some friends, not knowing where to go next and this is where I had my brilliant "aaha' moment.

my friend was saying the box analogy "so objects/array are like boxes you put an item in or you take one out" 
I’ve heard a dozen times in the last four weeks 

BUT,SOMETHING CLICKED

I thought to myself" it’s not really a box but a tipped over magic box or more like a tunnel and you have to dig these items “elements" out of this box or boxes" mannnnnn that random idea, you would of thought I just figured out the cure for cancer.

EVERYTHING STARTED CLICKING!

"omg I get it, I GET IT!"

Thursday: woke up, ate breakfast, sat at my computer ,with coffee.
I literally went around the slack channel to see if anyone wanted help, I was practically begging people for me to help them. that’s how excited I was to learn all over again, but I knew it would stick this time! jumped into a zoom chat with the teacher and was running with all the ideas/problems that where coming up....I WAS/AM ADDICTED NOW. That whole time  comparing it to a “SLOT MACHINE”, you either WIN OR BREAK!

I mean I still have to brush up on a few things, but now I embrace the problems , I run towards the issue to learn better.
then also realizing, I spent the whole day helping other people, and I didn’t get any of my own project done.
so then I sat for the rest of the night working (basically my code was Frankenstein together, but not bad for my first try ) went to bed with a big grin on my face "thank you Baby Jesus" I said as I went to bed.

Friday(today): woke up, ate breakfast, sat at my computer ,SMILED, with a cup of coffee.
and embraced whatever came my way, saying "thank you for letting it all click, thanks for getting unstuck, i am grateful lets ROCK  and ROLL."
rest of the day I talked to people, picking their knowledge straight from their brains. fixed any last-minute hiccups and here we are now.

So lesson is that maybe you just have to change your narrative, maybe you don’t? I really don’t know....but you have to pull your show strings tight, show up every day with your coffee and maybe, just maybe, something will click
( did I mention also lots and lots of reviewing).

but now I know that I will pass this flatiron bootcamp with flying colors because NOW I WANT TO!
