Better yet, why I only want to add value to the world.

So my name is Jonathan bleibdrey, I’m 32, Mexican....or so my ego tells me . I’m originally from a small town in Texas, then moved to the New York/New Jersey area. I was adopted when I was three to a white Italian family (it doesnt matter if they’re white just thought I’d share due to the times).With that being said, we had are fair share of racism in Texas (it sucked). My family allways loved that I was able to take those ugly moments, smile, and turn the other way. My mom would ask "Aren’t you going to get mad?" and I would reply "For what? So they can mess up my day? They have no control over me!"(give or take a word or two since I was a child).

Fast forward to the present times before the zombie apocaplypse happened,  I was a film maker. It was AMAZING! I MET BEYONCE, KEYONNA REEVES AND BATMAN!  Half-way through that journey, god/universe/baby jesus decided to WAKE me up! Now, I have feelings where feelings where never before. Let me explain, coming from a macho Texas background, where you hide your feelings, this is some intense STUFF! 

Which leads me to WHY I WANT TO BE A SOFTWARE ENGINEER! All I ever want to do now is add value to other people's lives...! In my journey, I learned a lot of random things for the BETTER, of course. One of my core values now is that, WE ARE NOT ONLY LEFT OR RIGHT BRAINERS. I put that in all caps because it’s important to remember this. We are told through "our conditioning" that we are either left or right brainers, creative or smart, black or white (figuratively). There are people that learn this early on in life, but for those who didn't, we are meant to be both: we are MAGICAL immortal BEINGS having a temporary HUMAN EXPERIENCE! So to answer my question from above, I want to become a software engineer to show that radical right brain artists can also be radically smart left brainers with a mix of changing the movie goers experience in some way. Maybe through virtual reality or somehow cut the middle man out completely and have those brand spankin’ new movies go directly to your hand held device.(who knows?)

So my "CODING JOURNEY" is a  SPIRITUAL JOURNEY, maybe to prove to myself I can actually do this or to prove to others that we can do anything if we put our minds to it. Also, to add value through the way we watch movies, to bring the family together again like when we watched "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air“, or “Home Improvement". The movie experience has not changed in decades, not to mention $20 DOLLAR popcorn!  I don't know how I’ll get there but, I know I will because there are only lessons or blessings in life  (I’ve learned a handful already). I allow the moment to unfold, I meditate, eat the occasional cheeseburger and from what I hear, we aren't supposed to really know how we will get there: we just have to BELIEVE that we WILL. so I thank you for your time... I LOVE YOU ALL, it’s  time to code!
